        <h1>Thor's Recipes</h1>
        <p>Almost everybody loves eating food, but if you're like me, cooking food is a chore.
            On this website I will give you some quick, easy and <em>delicious</em> (at least some times) vegetarian recipes.
        </p>
        <p>So get up from the couch, march to the store, and make some food!</p>
