        <h2>Spaghetti with Tomato Sauce</h2>
        <p>Now, this one is one I don't make often anymore,
            but there was a time where the majority of my meals consisted of this recipe.</p>
        <p>If you have the money, and somewhere to buy it, fresh Basil makes all the difference here.
            I know, dry Basil is cheaper and easier, and most of the time when I buy it fresh,
            I end up throwing half of it out because it spoils too fast.
            But this dish is ten times better with fresh Basil.
