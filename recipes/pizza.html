        <h2>Homemade vegetarian Pizza</h2>
        <p>Is there anything better than pizza? Yes there is. <em>Homemade</em> pizza.</p>
        <p>In this article I will describe how to make my usual homemade pizza.
            Grab a shopping bag and run to the store, because this pizza is <strong>delicious</strong>.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Pizza Dough</li>
            <li>Pizza Sauce</li>
            <li>Pizza Cheese</li>
            <li>Onion</li>
            <li>Cocktail Tomatoes (Normal Tomatoes work as well)</li>
            <li>Cream Cheese</li>
            <li>Pesto</li>
            <li>Optional: Basil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by pre-heating the oven to 200Â°C</li>
            <li>Spread the dough out with a rolling pin.
                If you don't want to deal with it getting stuck on the counter,
                my solution is to do it straight on the baking paper.
            </li>
            <li>Spread the Pizza Sauce over the pizza</li>
            <li>Spread the cheese over the pizza sauce. Try not to eat all of the cheese in advance.
                I sometimes fail at this.
            </li>
            <li>Cut the Onion in small circles. Spread them over the pizza.</li>
            <li>Chop the Cocktail Tomatoes in half. If you're using normal Tomatoes,
                try cutting them in wedges. Spread them over the pizza.
            </li>
            <li>Spread the cream cheese in small piles over the pizza.</li>
            <li>Finally, add the pesto and put it in the oven!</li>
            <li>Let it sit in the oven for 8 - 12 minutes.</li>
            <li>When finished, let it cool down for a few minutes.
                Otherwise you might do what I've done plenty of times and burn your mouth.</li>
        </ol>
