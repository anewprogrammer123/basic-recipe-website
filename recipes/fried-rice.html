        <h2>Homemade vegetarian Fried Rice</h2>
        <p>Well, we can't eat pizza every day - Believe me, I've tried.
            When you feel you're ready for something a little healthier,
            but still easy to make, fried rice is the way to go.
        </p>
        <p>I stole this recipe from another site, so please don't sue me.</p>

            <li>Butter</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by cooking your rice. It is best if they're cold when you start,
                but if you are like me, you didn't prepare for anything in your life.
            </li>
            <li>Whisk your Eggs and heat them in a pan with Butter.
                Scramble them after a short while.
            </li>
            <li>Remove the Eggs from the pan, and add more Butter.
                Fry the Carrots, Peas, Onions and Garlic over medium high heat.
            </li>
            <li>When the vegetables are soft, move them to one half of the pan.</li>
            <li>Add the Rice and the Soy Sauce. Change the pan to high heat and stir.</li>
            <li>After 2-3 minutes, remove the pan from the stove. Add Eggs, Green Onions
                and Sesame oil.
            </li>
            <li>If needed add Soy Sauce.</li>
        </ol>
